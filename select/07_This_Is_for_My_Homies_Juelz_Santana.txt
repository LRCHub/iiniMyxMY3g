This songs dedicated
To my homiez in that gangsta lean
Whyd you have 2 go so soon
It seems like yesterday
We were hangin round da hood
Now im gonna
Keep you memory alive
Like a homie should

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
Id like to keep steppin
But I cant get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be, we'll be hangin out

This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, that gangsta lean

My god, my god
Could you pass on a message from me
Tell him put down those dice for a second lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him
Ill never let go of his memory
So his son will know
You dont have to cry no more
Coz Gods got his back, I said Gods got his back

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
Id like to keep steppin
But I cant get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be, we'll be hangin out

This is for my homies
This is for my homies
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies
You know I miss you, You know I miss you, my homie
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean

Thats gotta homie thats in a gangsta lean
And also my boys in the Penn
